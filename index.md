I'm a Social and Data Scientist with an excitement for leveraging open data to learn more about people and the world. I'm currently wrapping up my PhD in Experimental Psychology where among other things I've focused on integrating standard psychological research with contemporary data science methods and technologies.

I also have a passion for teaching data science and am available for delivering workshops in programming [mainly using R](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/johnson+devin/) and statistical analysis.
